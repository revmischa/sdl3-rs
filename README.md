# SDL3 ![Crates.io Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/sdl3)

Bindings for SDL3 in Rust. Work in progress.

Now that the SDL3 API is mostly stabilized, we are working on a new version of the Rust bindings for SDL3.
The migration is in progress, and we are looking for contributors to help us complete it.

Right now the project isn't building because the migration is in progress.

## Migration Progress

- [ ] Update all modules to SDL3, use new [sdl3-sys](https://github.com/maia-s/sdl3-sys-rs) bindings,
  follow [migration guide](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/docs/README-migration.md).
- [ ] Fix tests.
- [ ] Update examples to SDL3.

Please refer to the [sdl3-rs](https://github.com/revmischa/sdl3-rs) repository for the latest updates.

The low-level bindings are being worked on in the [sdl3-sys](https://github.com/maia-s/sdl3-sys-rs) repository.

# Overview

This is an interface to use SDL3 from Rust.

Low-level C components are wrapped in Rust code to make them more idiomatic and
abstract away inappropriate manual memory management.

# Documentation

- [SDL3 higher-level documentation](https://docs.rs/sdl3/).
- [SDL3-sys lower-level bindings documentation](https://docs.rs/sdl3-sys/latest/sdl3_sys/)

# Contributing

We're looking for people to help get SDL3 support in Rust built, tested, and completed. You can help out!

Many examples and documentation requires updating. Interfaces have changed from SDL2 to SDL3, and the Rust bindings need
to be updated to reflect these changes.

If you see anything wrong, missing, or suboptimal, please feel free to open a PR with your improvements.

# History

This project was forked from [Rust-sdl2](https://github.com/Rust-sdl2/rust-sdl2) and the SDL2 code migrated to SDL3
according to the [SDL2->SDL3 migration guide](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/docs/README-migration.md).

If you want a library compatible with earlier versions of SDL, please
see [Rust-sdl2](https://github.com/Rust-sdl2/rust-sdl2).
